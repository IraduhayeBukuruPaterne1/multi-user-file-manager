## Project Overview

The **Multilingual File Manager Application** is a backend project built using **Node.js**. It simulates a collaborative workspace where multiple users can securely manage files. The app supports user authentication, multilingual user interfaces, asynchronous file handling, and unit-tested core functionalities.

### Key Objectives
- Develop a secure and robust backend application.
- Demonstrate proficiency in Node.js and database interactions.
- Implement multilingual support for global accessibility.
- Handle asynchronous tasks using Redis for file management.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with hashed passwords.
- **File Management**: Create, read, update, delete files, and organize directories.
- **Multilingual Support**: Choose from multiple languages for the user interface.
- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Efficient file uploads with progress tracking using Redis.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensure reliability of core functionalities with Jest/Mocha.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend framework for building scalable applications.
- **Express.js**: Simplified server setup and routing.
- **MySQL/MongoDB**: Database for storing user data and file metadata.
- **Redis**: Queuing system for managing asynchronous tasks.
- **i18next**: Library for multilingual support.
- **bcrypt**: Secure password hashing.
- **Jest/Mocha**: Testing frameworks for unit tests.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MySQL or MongoDB installed and configured.
- Redis server installed.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multilingual-file-manager.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd multilingual-file-manager
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure environment variables in a .env file:
env
Copy code
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port
Run database migrations (if applicable):
bash
Copy code
npm run migrate
Start the application:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Register a new user through the /register endpoint.
Log in with your credentials at the /login endpoint.
Access your workspace to manage files:
Create, read, update, and delete files and directories.
Change your preferred language through the /language endpoint.
Upload files and track progress using the provided API routes.
Testing
To run the unit tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test
The tests cover:

User authentication.
File CRUD operations.
Queuing system functionality.
Challenges and Solutions
Handling Concurrent File Uploads
Challenge: Overloading the server during multiple uploads.
Solution: Integrated Redis with a queuing library to process tasks efficiently.
Dynamic Multilingual Support
Challenge: Applying translations dynamically across the app.
Solution: Used middleware to fetch and apply user-selected languages seamlessly.
Future Enhancements
File Versioning: Track and manage file versions.
Search Functionality: Add a search feature to find files quickly.
Cloud Integration: Connect to cloud storage services for file management.
