## Project Overview

The **Multilingual File Manager Application** is a backend project built using **Node.js**. It simulates a collaborative workspace where multiple users can securely manage files. The app supports user authentication, multilingual user interfaces, asynchronous file handling, and unit-tested core functionalities.

### Key Objectives
- Develop a secure and robust backend application.
- Demonstrate proficiency in Node.js and database interactions.
- Implement multilingual support for global accessibility.
- Handle asynchronous tasks using Redis for file management.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with hashed passwords.
- **File Management**: Create, read, update, delete files, and organize directories.
- **Multilingual Support**: Choose from multiple languages for the user interface.
- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Efficient file uploads with progress tracking using Redis.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensure reliability of core functionalities with Jest/Mocha.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend framework for building scalable applications.
- **Express.js**: Simplified server setup and routing.
- **MySQL/MongoDB**: Database for storing user data and file metadata.
- **Redis**: Queuing system for managing asynchronous tasks.
- **i18next**: Library for multilingual support.
- **bcrypt**: Secure password hashing.
- **Jest/Mocha**: Testing frameworks for unit tests.

Testing
To execute unit tests, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
The tests cover:

User authentication.
File CRUD operations.
Queuing system functionality.
Challenges and Solutions
1. Handling Concurrent File Uploads
Challenge: The server experienced potential overload during multiple simultaneous uploads.
Solution: Integrated Redis with a queuing library to manage tasks asynchronously and prevent overload.
2. Dynamic Multilingual Support
Challenge: Ensuring translations dynamically applied across the application.
Solution: Middleware was implemented to fetch and apply user-selected languages seamlessly.
Future Enhancements
