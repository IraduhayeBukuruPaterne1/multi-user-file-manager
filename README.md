## Project Overview

The **Multilingual File Manager Application** is a backend project built using **Node.js**. It simulates a collaborative workspace where multiple users can securely manage files. The app supports user authentication, multilingual user interfaces, asynchronous file handling, and unit-tested core functionalities.

### Key Objectives
- Develop a secure and robust backend application.
- Demonstrate proficiency in Node.js and database interactions.
- Implement multilingual support for global accessibility.
- Handle asynchronous tasks using Redis for file management.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with hashed passwords.
- **File Management**: Create, read, update, delete files, and organize directories.
- **Multilingual Support**: Choose from multiple languages for the user interface.
- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Efficient file uploads with progress tracking using Redis.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensure reliability of core functionalities with Jest/Mocha.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend framework for building scalable applications.
- **Express.js**: Simplified server setup and routing.
- **MySQL/MongoDB**: Database for storing user data and file metadata.
- **Redis**: Queuing system for managing asynchronous tasks.
- **i18next**: Library for multilingual support.
- **bcrypt**: Secure password hashing.
- **Jest/Mocha**: Testing frameworks for unit tests.

**Challenges and Solutions**

Developing the Multilingual File Manager Application presented several challenges that required innovative solutions. One major hurdle was handling concurrent file uploads efficiently without overloading the server. To address this, we integrated Redis with a queuing system, ensuring smooth processing and tracking of multiple file uploads simultaneously. Another significant challenge was implementing dynamic internationalization (i18n) across the application. This required designing middleware capable of detecting user-selected languages and applying them in real time. By leveraging the i18next library, we created a seamless multilingual experience for users, enhancing global accessibility. These solutions not only improved the applicationâ€™s performance but also contributed to a more user-friendly interface.
